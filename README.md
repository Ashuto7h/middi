# Middi
### A habit tracker in the form of a chat bot

Middi is a fun and wholesome habit tracker that makes you feel good for completing habits. The Middi app takes place in a chat-like interface where users get support and encouragement every time they complete a habit. Manage your habits, complete your goals and feel good doing it.

This project was made for the [Digital Ocean X Dev Hackathon 2020](https://dev.to/devteam/announcing-the-digitalocean-app-platform-hackathon-on-dev-2i1k). It's built using NodeJS, Express and Sequelize for the backend and React with Typescript for the frontend.
